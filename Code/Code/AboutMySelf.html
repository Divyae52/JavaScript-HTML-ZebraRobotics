	<body>
		My name is Aidan. I live near the intersection Britannia Rd W and Winston Churchill Blvd.
		I am in Grade 5, nearing Grade 6 in September. I am in the gifted program, and so school ends up being harder, and there is more homework. However, it's all way more fun, due to coding and robotics in class for projects.
		My Hobbies include coding, designing, reading, and doing things outside.
		I enjoy programming a lot. I first started thinking about it in grade 1, and in grade 2 I started scratch. I enjoy programming because I find it interesting and fun, and I want to make aps full time when I grow up.
		Update: I am now in the May of 2022, meaning I'm in Grade 6
