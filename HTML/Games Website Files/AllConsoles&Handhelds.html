                                The original PlayStation, released in Japan on December 3, 1994, was the first of the ubiquitous PlayStation series of console and hand-held game devices. By December 2003, the PlayStation and PS one had shipped a combined total of 102.49 million units, eventually becoming the first video game console to sell 120 million units.

It is backwards-compatible with most original PlayStation games. On November 29, 2005, the PS2 became the fastest game console to reach 100 million units shipped, accomplishing the feat within 5 years and 9 months from its launch. On January 4, 2013 PS2 production had ended worldwide, but studies showed that many people all around the world still own one even if it is no longer in use.

                            Released on November 11, 2006 in Japan, the PlayStation 3 (PS3) is a seventh generation game console from Sony. It competes with the Microsoft Xbox 360 and the Nintendo Wii. The PS3 is the first console in the series to introduce the use of motion-sensing technology. The PS3 was originally offered with either a 20 GB or 60 GB hard drive, but over the years its capacity increased in increments available up to 500 GB.

                            The PlayStation 4 (PS4) was announced by Sony Computer Entertainment at a press conference on February 20, 2013, where Sony revealed some hardware specifications of the new console. It was first released in North America on November 15, 2013. The eighth-generation system, launched in the fourth quarter of 2013, introduced the x86 architecture to the PlayStation series. Development started all the way in 2008, and the Playstation Europe CEO emphasized in 2011 that Sony wanted to avoid launching the next-generation console behind the competition. Sony also introduced the PlayStation App, allowing PS4 owners to turn smartphones and tablets into a second screen to enhance gameplay.

                                The PS5 was released worldwide on November 12, 2020, and is part of the ninth generation of video game consoles. The console uses an 8-core, 16-thread CPU based on AMD's Zen 2 microarchitecture, manufactured on the 7 nanometer process node. The graphics processor is a custom variant of AMD's Navi family using the RDNA microarchitecture, which includes support for hardware acceleration of ray-tracing rendering, enabling real-time ray-traced graphics. The new console ships with a custom SSD storage, as Cerny emphasized the need for fast loading times and larger bandwidth to make games more immersive, as well as to support the required content streaming from disc for 8K resolution. The PlayStation 5 features a completely revamped user interface. The PlayStation 5 is backwards-compatible with most PlayStation 4 and PlayStation VR games, with Cerny stating that the transition to the new console is meant to be a soft one.

This, however, can make a major difference, as it limits you to have to buy any games from the online store, which can cost more than from a store in real life. In addition, you can't trade these games with others, making you have access to less games, even if your friends had been okay lending you games. Finally, it doesn't have a disk drive, meaning you don't get the good quality movie player. While it's more than $100 cheaper, a good movie player can cost much more. </p></center></small>
