            <h4> <ins>Pokémon</ins> Unite Survey Wants To Know Which Parts Of The Game Frustrate You </h4> <h6><sup> 7/26/2021 </sup></h6>
            <p> <ins>Pokémon</ins> Unite is now available on <ins>Nintendo</ins> Switch – a mobile version is also on the way later this year – and the development team is looking for your feedback. <br>If you've been playing the game over the past few days and have any thoughts on what you like or don't like about it, make sure to head on over to the survey page to have your say. <br> Early questions ask about your playstyle (such as whether you play mostly handheld or docked and how far you've progressed through the game's levels), but they soon address more particular topics. <br>Later questions ask you to give the game an overall rating, say whether or not you find its concept original or unique, and even ask you about how satisfied you are with game elements such as its technical performance, gameplay mechanics, and player progression outside of battle (such as unlocking <ins>Pokémon</ins> or buying Trainer fashion items, for example). <br>Towards the end of the survey, players are asked to select any areas that leave them frustrated. <br> Options include having to spend money to be successful, an emphasis on grinding to win, and difficulty when having to communicate with other players. <br> </p>
            <h4> NEO: The World Ends With You Review </h4> </h4> <h6><sup> 7/24/2021 </sup></h6>
            <p> For the past 13 years, fans of the <ins>Nintendo</ins> DS cult classic, The World Ends With You have been practically begging Square Enix to whip up a new entry in the world of the original. <br> The vibes of that first venture are flavour-rich, boasting a bouncy and energetic soundtrack, a loveable cast of characters, and a combat system just as unique as the rest of the game. <br> So we were thrilled to bits when the news of a sequel came across our desk last year, although at the same time cautious, as we hold the tale of the first game close to our hearts. <br> Would the story of the original have been better off left untouched by NEO: The World Ends With You? Do the creators really have the gusto to match or exceed the energy from that first waltz through Shibuya? Will the new protagonist Rindo and the rest of these runts ever be able to live up to the likes of Neku and company? We’ve been asking ourselves these same questions for weeks, months even, and thankfully it was all for naught. <br> This new action-RPG romp through Shibuya’s streets is full of fresh beats and surprising treats to appease longtime fans and newcomers alike. <br> (Continue the story at: https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/neo_the_world_ends_with_you) </p>
            <h4> Rumour: <ins>Nintendo</ins> To End Submissions For New Wii U And ③DS eShop Games </h4> </h4> <h6><sup> 7/26/2021 </sup></h6>
            <p> <ins>Nintendo</ins> could be preparing to wind down ③DS and Wii U eShop game releases, according to a new rumour. <br> YouTube channel Impact Game Station has supposedly "received a message from someone" about <ins>Nintendo</ins>'s European branch ceasing the acceptance of submissions for new eShop releases on the ③DS and Wii U by early next year. <br> The obvious guess is <ins>Nintendo</ins> has notified developers about it. <br> Here is the letter in full, stating how acceptance of submissions for new titles will end as of 1st April 2022 <br> <i>"We hereby wish to inform you, that it has been decided to cease the acceptance of submissions for new <ins>Nintendo</ins> ③DS / Wii U titles for eShop release by the end of the current fiscal year (effective from 1st April 2022). <br> These new titles should be lotcheck approved latest within ③ months after the submission deadline. <br> The <ins>Nintendo</ins> ③DS / Wii U eShops will remain active and submissions of patches will still be processed until further notice. <br> Please take these deadlines into your considerations in your planning for upcoming <ins>Nintendo</ins> ③DS and Wii U digital releases. <br> Thank you very much for your understanding and continuous support on the <ins>Nintendo</ins> ③DS and Wii U consoles during the past years. <br> Kind regards, <sup><ins>Nintendo</ins> of Europe -</sup><sub> European Publisher Business</sub>" </i> <br> If this is more than a rumour, it's worth noting it's not the end of these platforms just yet. <br> The same message highlights how the ③DS and Wii U eShops will continue to "remain active" and patches will still be processed until further notice. <br> This follows on from <ins>Nintendo</ins> announcing earlier this week it would be removing credit card support from the ③DS and Wii U eShops in Japan, as of next January. <br> This has already happened in regions like Europe and Australia. <br> Can you see <ins>Nintendo</ins> wanting to end new game support for these older platforms by next April? Share your thoughts below. <br> </p>
