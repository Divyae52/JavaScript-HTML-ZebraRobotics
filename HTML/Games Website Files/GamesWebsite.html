				<h3> <ins> Minecraft </ins> </h3>
				<h1><div class="width-20"><a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/get-minecraft"><img src="Minecraft.png" height="191.5" width="127.5"></a></h1></div>
				<p> <ins> Minecraft </ins> is a sandbox video game developed by the Swedish video game developer Mojang Studios. <br> The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson, and is now avalible on most computers/mobile devices/consoles. <br> In <ins> Minecraft </ins>, players explore a blocky, procedurally-generated ③D world with virtually infinite terrain, and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures or earthworks. <br> Depending on game mode, players can fight computer-controlled mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. <br> Game modes include a survival mode, in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources and access to flight. <br> Players can modify the game to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets. <br> </p>
				<h3> <ins> Fortnite </ins> </h3>
				<h1><div class="width-20"><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/download"><img src="Fortnite.jpg" height="77.5" width="90"></a></h1></div>
				<p> <ins> Fortnite </ins> is an online video game developed by Epic Games and released in 2017. <br> It is available in three distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: <ins> Fortnite </ins>: Save the World, a cooperative hybrid-tower defense-shooter-survival game for up to four players to fight off zombie-like creatures and defend objects with traps and fortifications they can build; <ins> Fortnite </ins> Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle royale game in which up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; and <ins> Fortnite </ins> Creative, in which players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas. <br> </p>

				<h1><div class="width-20"><a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/V/"><img src="G.T.A.V..png" height="72.5" width="82.5"></a></h1></div>
				<p> <ins> Grand Theft Auto V </ins> is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. <br> It is the first main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series since 2008's Grand Theft Auto IV. <br> The game is played from either a third-person or first-person perspective, and its world is navigated on foot and by vehicle. <br> Players control the three lead protagonists throughout single-player and switch among them, both during and outside missions. <br> The story is centred on the heist sequences, and many missions involve shooting and driving gameplay. <br> A "wanted" system governs the aggression of law enforcement response to players who commit crimes. <br> ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Grand Theft Auto Online, the game's online multiplayer mode, lets up to 30 players engage in a variety of different cooperative and competitive game modes. <br> </p>
				<h3> <ins> League of Legends </ins> </h3>
				<h1><div class="width-20"><a href="https://signup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/signup/index#/"><img src="LoL.jpg" height="89.5" width="160.7"></a></h1></div>
				<p> <ins> League of Legends </ins>, commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games. <br> Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre. <br> In the game, two teams of five players battle in player versus player combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. <br> Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with unique abilities and differing styles of play. <br> During a match, champions become more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. <br> In the game's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying their "Nexus", a large structure located within. <br> </p>
				<h3> <ins> Roblox </ins> </h3>
				<h1><div class="width-20"><a href="https://web.roblox.com/home"> <img src="Roblox.jpg" height="120" width="90"></a> </h1></div>
				<p> <ins> Roblox </ins> is an online game platform and game creation system developed by <ins> Roblox </ins> Corporation. <br> It allows users to program games and play games created by other users. <br> <ins> Roblox </ins> allows players to create their own games using its proprietary engine, <ins> Roblox </ins> Studio, which can then be played by other users. <br> Games are coded under an object-oriented programming system utilizing a dialect of the programming language Lua to manipulate the environment of the game. <br> Users are able to create purchasable content through one-time purchases, known as "game passes", as well as microtransactions which can be purchased more than once, known as "developer products" or "products". <br> Revenue from purchases is split between the developer and the <ins> Roblox </ins> Corporation 30-70, in favor of <ins> Roblox </ins> Corp. <br> The majority of games produced using <ins> Roblox </ins> Studio are developed by minors, and a total of 20 million games a year are produced using it. <br> </p>

				<div class="width-33"> <h4> <ins>Pokémon</ins> Unite Survey Wants To Know Which Parts Of The Game Frustrate You </h4> <h6><sup> 7/26/2021 </sup></h6>
				<p> <ins>Pokémon</ins> Unite is now available on <ins>Nintendo</ins> Switch - a mobile version is also on the way later this year - and the development team is looking for your feedback. <br>If you've been playing the game over the past few days and have any thoughts on what you like or don't like about it, make sure to head on over to the survey page to have your say. <br> Early questions ask about your playstyle (such as whether you play mostly handheld or docked and how far you've progressed through the game's levels), but they soon address more particular topics. <br>Later questions ask you to give the game an overall rating, say whether or not you find its concept original or unique, and even ask you about how satisfied you are with game elements such as its technical performance, gameplay mechanics, and player progression outside of battle (such as unlocking <ins>Pokémon</ins> or buying Trainer fashion items, for example). <br>Towards the end of the survey, players are asked to select any areas that leave them frustrated. <br> Options include having to spend money to be successful, an emphasis on grinding to win, and difficulty when having to communicate with other players. <br> </p> </div>
				<div class="width-33"><h4> NEO: The World Ends With You Review ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀</h4> </h4> <h6><sup> 7/24/2021 </sup></h6>
				<p> For the past 13 years, fans of the <ins>Nintendo</ins> DS cult classic, The World Ends With You have been practically begging Square Enix to whip up a new entry in the world of the original. <br> The vibes of that first venture are flavour-rich, boasting a bouncy and energetic soundtrack, a loveable cast of characters, and a combat system just as unique as the rest of the game. <br> So we were thrilled to bits when the news of a sequel came across our desk last year, although at the same time cautious, as we hold the tale of the first game close to our hearts. <br> Would the story of the original have been better off left untouched by NEO: The World Ends With You? Do the creators really have the gusto to match or exceed the energy from that first waltz through Shibuya? Will the new protagonist Rindo and the rest of these runts ever be able to live up to the likes of Neku and company? We’ve been asking ourselves these same questions for weeks, months even, and thankfully it was all for naught. <br> This new action-RPG romp through Shibuya’s streets is full of fresh beats and surprising treats to appease longtime fans and newcomers alike. <br> (Continue the story at: https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/neo_the_world_ends_with_you) </p></div>
				<div class="width-33"><h4> Rumour: <ins>Nintendo</ins> To End Submissions For New Wii U And ③DS eShop Games </h4> </h4> <h6><sup> 7/26/2021 </sup></h6>
				<p> <ins>Nintendo</ins> could be preparing to wind down ③DS and Wii U eShop game releases, according to a new rumour. <br> YouTube channel Impact Game Station has supposedly "received a message from someone" about <ins>Nintendo</ins>'s European branch ceasing the acceptance of submissions for new eShop releases on the ③DS and Wii U by early next year. <br> The obvious guess is <ins>Nintendo</ins> has notified developers about it. <br> Here is the letter in full, stating how acceptance of submissions for new titles will end as of 1st April 2022 <br> <i>"We hereby wish to inform you, that it has been decided to cease the acceptance of submissions for new <ins>Nintendo</ins> ③DS / Wii U titles for eShop release by the end of the current fiscal year (effective from 1st April 2022). <br> These new titles should be lotcheck approved latest within ③ months after the submission deadline. <br> The <ins>Nintendo</ins> ③DS / Wii U eShops will remain active and submissions of patches will still be processed until further notice. <br> Please take these deadlines into your considerations in your planning for upcoming <ins>Nintendo</ins> ③DS and Wii U digital releases. <br> Thank you very much for your understanding and continuous support on the <ins>Nintendo</ins> ③DS and Wii U consoles during the past years. <br> Kind regards, <sup><ins>Nintendo</ins> of Europe -</sup><sub> European Publisher Business</sub>" </i> <br> If this is more than a rumour, it's worth noting it's not the end of these platforms just yet. <br> The same message highlights how the ③DS and Wii U eShops will continue to "remain active" and patches will still be processed until further notice. <br> This follows on from <ins>Nintendo</ins> announcing earlier this week it would be removing credit card support from the ③DS and Wii U eShops in Japan, as of next January. <br> This has already happened in regions like Europe and Australia. <br> Can you see <ins>Nintendo</ins> wanting to end new game support for these older platforms by next April? Share your thoughts below. <br> </p> </div>
